# eslint-config-invh-eslint-prettier

Tired of headaches, of worrying 'is this code formatted just right, are my
semicolons fully coloned?' Well, worry no longer friend. Simply run this line of
code in the ole terminal there,

```
npm install https://github.com/shaneu/eslint-config-invh-eslint-prettier
```

and make sure there's a .eslintrc file with one single line in it:

```
 {
   "extends": "invh-prettier-eslint"
 }
```

That's it. Your problems are over.
